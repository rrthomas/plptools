/**
 * Remote ClipBoard services via PLP
 *
 * This class implements access to the remote clipboard notification
 * feature of the Psion. The Psion uses a file C:\System\Data\Clpboard.cbd
 * for storing the content of its clipboard. This file can be accessed like
 * any other regular file on the Psion using the @ref rfsv implementation.
 * This class handles notification about changes of this file.
 * There are two methods of notification implemented. Using @ref waitNotify ,
 * a blocking method can be used and using @ref sendListen followed by
 * @ref checkNotify , a polling approach (usable for GUI programs) can
 * be implemented.
